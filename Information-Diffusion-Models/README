This repository contains three different information diffusion models implemented in MATLAB:

1. Linear Threshold Model (LTM) - `LTM.m`
2. Hegselmann-Krause Opinion Dynamics (HK) - `HK.m`
3. Independent Cascade Model (IC) - `opinionProp_IC.m`

Each model simulates how information/opinions spread across a network.
